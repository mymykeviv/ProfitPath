# Services

This directory is intended for business logic services that handle complex operations and business rules for the ProfitPath ERP system. Services act as an intermediate layer between controllers and models, encapsulating business logic and providing reusable functionality.

## Purpose

Services are designed to:
- **Encapsulate Business Logic** - Complex business rules and calculations
- **Promote Reusability** - Shared functionality across multiple controllers
- **Maintain Separation of Concerns** - Keep controllers thin and focused
- **Handle Complex Operations** - Multi-step processes and transactions
- **Integrate External Systems** - Third-party API integrations

## Planned Services

While no services are currently implemented, the following services are planned for future development:

### Core Business Services
- **ProductService** - Product lifecycle management and calculations
- **InventoryService** - Stock management and valuation logic
- **PricingService** - Dynamic pricing and discount calculations
- **TaxService** - GST calculations and compliance

### Production Services
- **BOMService** - Bill of Materials calculations and validations
- **ProductionPlanningService** - Production scheduling and resource planning
- **CostCalculationService** - Production cost analysis and reporting
- **QualityControlService** - Quality management and testing workflows

### Financial Services
- **PaymentProcessingService** - Payment handling and reconciliation
- **ReportingService** - Financial reports and analytics
- **AgingService** - Accounts receivable/payable aging calculations
- **CashFlowService** - Cash flow projections and analysis

### Integration Services
- **EmailService** - Email notifications and communications
- **NotificationService** - System alerts and reminders
- **ExportService** - Data export to various formats (PDF, Excel, CSV)
- **BackupService** - Database backup and restore operations

## Service Structure

Services should follow this general structure:

```javascript
class ExampleService {
  constructor() {
    // Initialize dependencies
  }

  async performBusinessOperation(data) {
    try {
      // Validate input
      this.validateInput(data);
      
      // Perform business logic
      const result = await this.executeBusinessLogic(data);
      
      // Return processed result
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle and log errors
      throw new Error(`Business operation failed: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }

  validateInput(data) {
    // Input validation logic
  }

  async executeBusinessLogic(data) {
    // Core business logic implementation
  }
}

module.exports = ExampleService;
```

## Usage Patterns

Services should be used in controllers for:

```javascript
const ExampleService = require('../services/ExampleService');
const exampleService = new ExampleService();

// In controller method
async function controllerMethod(req, res) {
  try {
    const result = await exampleService.performBusinessOperation(req.body);
    res.json({ success: true, data: result });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ success: false, error: error.message });
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Service Design
- **Single Responsibility** - Each service should have a clear, focused purpose
- **Dependency Injection** - Services should receive dependencies through constructor
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages
- **Async/Await** - Use modern async patterns for database operations
- **Testing** - Services should be easily testable with mocked dependencies

### Business Logic
- **Validation** - Always validate input data before processing
- **Transactions** - Use database transactions for multi-step operations
- **Logging** - Log important business events and errors
- **Performance** - Optimize for performance with efficient queries
- **Security** - Implement proper authorization and data sanitization

## Current Implementation

Currently, business logic is implemented directly in controllers and models. As the application grows, complex business logic should be extracted into dedicated service classes to improve maintainability and testability.

## Future Development

Services will be implemented as needed when:
- Business logic becomes too complex for controllers
- Multiple controllers need to share the same functionality
- External integrations are required
- Complex calculations or multi-step processes are needed

This directory serves as a placeholder for future service implementations and provides a clear structure for organizing business logic as the application evolves.
